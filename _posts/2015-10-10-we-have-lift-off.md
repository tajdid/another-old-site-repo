With 2016 right around the corner, I’m setting myself a small goal before this year ends. I’m going to start blogging. Yep, that’s right. Some of you know (yes, you!) that I tried this several times before, but it just faded away all the time because I’m not confident in my writing, but there’s no harm in trying again for the 400th (whoa, maybe like 4th) time, no?

I’m not sure yet what I will write in here or what I will share, if I do share anything as you all know it will be related to my life as a student and designer. Maybe I’ll share some design links weekly? The point is to just write, right?

Well then, this should be fun!
