Here's the first take on what has piqued my interest the past week. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Laboriosam recusandae ipsam doloremque cumque doloribus, odit aliquid delectus mollitia reprehenderit animi soluta commodi magnam laudantium dolorum, quis blanditiis pariatur beatae cupiditate.


1. [Design Disruptors](http://www.designdisruptors.com/) - This is a trailer for a documentary titled _"Design Disruptors"_ made by the awesome people at [InVision](http://invisionapp.com). The film reveals design’s role as a key competitive advantage at Airbnb, Google, Pinterest, and more.
2. [Material Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/) - A really simple and easy to use colour palette for material design. Just click, pick and go!
3. [Exposé]() - Expose is a Bash script that turns images and videos in a folder into a photoessay similar to [jack.ventures](http://jack.ventures) or [jack.works](http://jack.works) (the authors personal blogs). As a fan of static site generators this looks very interesting!
4. [Letter to a Junior Designer](http://alistapart.com/column/letter-to-a-junior-designer) - An inspirational letter to junior designers, but hell, everyone should give it a read.
